# Product Context

**Version:** 1.0.0

## Purpose and Problem Solved

Guidant is designed to automate and streamline the software development lifecycle, from initial idea generation and requirements gathering to task management and autonomous research. It addresses the inefficiencies and manual bottlenecks inherent in traditional development processes, providing an AI-powered solution for project discovery, planning, and execution.

**Problems Solved:**
- **Manual Requirements Gathering:** Replaces tedious, error-prone manual processes with AI-guided discovery sessions.
- **Inefficient Task Breakdown:** Automates the decomposition of complex projects into manageable, prioritized tasks.
- **Lack of Real-time Information:** Integrates multi-provider AI research to provide context-aware, real-time data for informed decision-making.
- **Disjointed Workflows:** Unifies various stages of development (discovery, planning, execution, research) into a seamless, AI-orchestrated workflow.
- **High Development Costs:** Optimizes resource utilization and AI provider routing to achieve significant cost savings.

## How Guidant Works

Guidant operates through a series of interconnected AI-driven modules:

1.  **Discovery Session Management:**
    *   AI-guided sessions help users articulate project ideas, which are then transformed into structured functional and non-functional requirements.
    *   Includes market research and technical feasibility validation to ensure project viability.
    *   Synthesizes findings into comprehensive Product Requirements Documents (PRDs).

2.  **Intelligent Task Management System:**
    *   AI breaks down PRDs into granular tasks, managing dependencies and prioritizing them based on business value, complexity, and other criteria.
    *   Supports tag-based organization for flexible project structuring and progress tracking.

3.  **Autonomous Research Integration:**
    *   Leverages multiple AI research providers (Vertex AI, Context7, Tavily, Perplexity) to conduct real-time, context-aware research.
    *   Autonomous research agents gather information, analyze data, and provide insights for decision-making.

4.  **MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration:**
    *   Provides a rich ecosystem of 40+ specialized tools, enabling seamless interaction with various AI assistants (Claude, GPT) and development environments.
    *   The extensible architecture allows for custom tool development.

5.  **Cloud-Native Autonomous Agents:**
    *   Utilizes the Mastra AI Framework for orchestrating research agents, deployed on Google Cloud Run for scalability.
    *   Specialized agents handle tasks like technology research, UI/UX analysis, and competitive intelligence.

## User Experience Goals

-   **Intuitive and Streamlined:** Users should find the process of defining, planning, and executing projects significantly simpler and faster than traditional methods.
-   **Intelligent Assistance:** The AI should proactively assist users, offering insights, suggestions, and automating repetitive tasks without requiring constant manual intervention.
-   **Comprehensive Visibility:** Users should have clear, real-time visibility into project progress, task statuses, and research findings.
-   **Adaptable and Flexible:** The system should accommodate various project types and team structures, allowing for customization and integration with existing tools.
-   **Reliable and Accurate:** The AI-generated outputs (requirements, task breakdowns, research) should be highly accurate and actionable, building user trust.

## Target Audience Needs

-   **Development Teams:** Need to reduce manual overhead, accelerate development cycles, and integrate AI into their daily workflows. Guidant provides automated task breakdown, dependency management, and AI-assisted coding.
-   **Project Managers:** Require intelligent planning tools, accurate progress tracking, and automated reporting. Guidant offers AI-driven prioritization, comprehensive dashboards, and PRD generation.
-   **Solo Developers:** Benefit from structured project organization, automated research, and AI assistance across all development phases, enabling them to manage complex projects independently.
-   **AI-Enhanced Development Workflows:** Teams using tools like Cursor and Claude need seamless integration with an intelligent project management system that complements their AI-first approach.

Guidant aims to be the intelligent co-pilot for software development, empowering users to achieve unprecedented levels of efficiency and insight.
