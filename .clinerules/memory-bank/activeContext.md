# Active Context

**Version:** 1.0.0

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on initializing the memory bank for the Guidant project. This involves ensuring all core documentation files are present and up-to-date, providing a comprehensive overview of the project's purpose, architecture, technology stack, and current status.

## Recent Changes

-   `productContext.md` has been created/updated.
-   `systemPatterns.md` has been created/updated.
-   `techContext.md` has been created/updated.

## Next Steps

1.  Create/Update `progress.md` to reflect the current status and remaining tasks.
2.  Verify all core memory bank files are correctly initialized.
3.  Confirm the memory bank is ready for ongoing project documentation.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

-   Ensuring consistency across all documentation files.
-   Maintaining a clear and concise writing style for easy understanding.
-   Structuring information to be easily retrievable by an AI agent.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

-   **AI-First Development:** All documentation should reflect the core philosophy of AI-first development, where AI is central to the project's operation.
-   **Modularity:** Documentation should highlight the modular nature of Guidant's architecture.
-   **Clarity and Precision:** Technical details should be accurate and unambiguous.

## Learnings and Project Insights

-   The memory bank is crucial for maintaining context across sessions, especially given the agent's memory reset.
-   Well-structured documentation significantly improves the efficiency of task execution and problem-solving.
