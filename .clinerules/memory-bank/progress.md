# Progress

**Version:** 1.0.0

## What Works

-   **Core Task Management:** Complete CRUD operations with dependency management.
-   **Discovery Workflows:** AI-guided requirements gathering and PRD generation.
-   **MCP Integration:** Full MCP server with 40+ tools.
-   **Multi-Provider AI:** Support for 8+ AI providers with intelligent routing.
-   **Research Capabilities:** Context-aware research with multiple data sources.
-   **CLI Interface:** Comprehensive command-line tool with interactive features.

## What's Left to Build

-   **Mastra AI Integration:** Cloud-native autonomous research agents.
-   **Firestore Migration:** Moving from JSON to cloud-native data storage.
-   **Enhanced Autonomous Capabilities:** Eliminating manual stage progression.
-   **Browser Automation:** Stagehand integration for UI/UX research.
-   **Performance Optimization:** Advanced caching and cost reduction strategies.

## Current Status

The project is in active development, focusing on integrating the Mastra AI framework and migrating data to Firestore. The core functionalities for task management, discovery, and MCP integration are stable and operational.

## Known Issues

-   Potential for AI provider rate limits during heavy research loads (mitigation strategies in place).
-   Performance considerations for very large datasets before full Firestore migration.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

-   Initial focus on JSON-based storage for rapid prototyping, now transitioning to Firestore for scalability and robustness.
-   Continuous evaluation of AI providers to ensure optimal cost-efficiency and performance.
-   Emphasis on modular architecture to facilitate future expansions and integrations.
