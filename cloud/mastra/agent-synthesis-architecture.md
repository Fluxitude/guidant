# Agent Synthesis Architecture for Guidant

## Overview
Strategic transformation of Guidant's 48 MCP tools through intelligent Agent Synthesis Architecture using Mastra AI framework. This approach optimizes complex operations with AI agents while preserving direct tool calls for simple operations, resulting in more efficient workflows and actionable insights.

## Problem Statement
Current Guidant architecture with 48 MCP tools creates:
- Inefficient workflows for complex research/analysis operations
- Generic, non-contextual results from multi-tool sequences
- Manual synthesis burden for complex data analysis
- Slow response times for research-heavy operations
- Over-engineering of simple CRUD operations

## Solution: Strategic Agent Synthesis Architecture

### Core Principle
**Not all tools need agent synthesis** - Apply intelligent categorization:

#### ðŸ”¬ **Complex Operations** â†’ **Agent Synthesis** (~10 tools)
Research, analysis, and multi-step workflows that benefit from AI orchestration

#### ðŸ“‹ **Simple Operations** â†’ **Direct Tool Calls** (~38 tools)  
CRUD operations, utilities, and straightforward functions that should remain fast and direct

#### ðŸ¤– **Hybrid Approach**
Agents can call direct tools when needed, creating flexible workflows

## Tool Categorization Strategy

### **Research/Analysis Tools** (Agent Synthesis Required)
Tools that involve complex research, analysis, and synthesis workflows:

- `research_guidant` - Complex research with project context
- `research_market_opportunity` - Multi-source market analysis  
- `validate_technical_feasibility` - Technical research + Context7 integration
- `analyze_project_complexity` - Deep analysis workflows
- `prioritize_tasks` - Multi-criteria analysis and decision-making
- `generate_progress_summary` - Synthesis of project data
- `generate_handoff_report` - Complex report generation
- `generate_prd` - Synthesis of discovery session data

**Result**: ~8-10 tools â†’ 4 specialized synthesis agents

### **Task Management Tools** (Keep Direct)
Simple CRUD operations that should remain fast and efficient:

- `get_tasks`, `add_task`, `update_task`, `remove_task`
- `get_task`, `next_task`, `set_task_status`
- `move_task`, `add_dependency`, `remove_dependency`
- `add_subtask`, `remove_subtask`, `clear_subtasks`
- `expand_task`, `expand_all`

**Result**: ~15-20 tools remain as efficient direct calls

### **Project Management Tools** (Keep Direct)
Utilities and simple operations that don't require AI synthesis:

- `manage_sprint`, `manage_work_session`
- `add_tag`, `delete_tag`, `use_tag`, `rename_tag`
- `generate_guidant`, `get_work_context`, `complexity_report`
- `validate_dependencies`, `fix_dependencies`
- `list_tags`, `copy_tag`, `rename_tag`

**Result**: ~10-15 tools remain as utilities

### **Light AI Enhancement** (Optional)
Tools that could benefit from optional AI assistance:

- `expand_task` - AI-assisted subtask breakdown
- `update_guidant` - AI-determined update strategies
- `parse_prd` - Enhanced requirement extraction

**Result**: ~5-8 tools with optional AI assistance

## Agent Architecture Design

### **1. Research Synthesis Agent**
**Purpose**: Handle all research-heavy operations with intelligent synthesis

**Capabilities**:
- Performs actual research through tools (web search, APIs, databases)
- Synthesizes multi-source data into comprehensive insights
- Provides contextual, actionable analysis instead of raw data

**Tools Used Internally**:
- `research_guidant`, `research_market_opportunity`
- Tavily search, Context7 documentation
- External APIs and databases

**Example Usage**:
```typescript
const researchAgent = new Agent({
  name: "Research Synthesis Agent",
  instructions: "Conduct thorough research and provide actionable insights",
  model: gemini("gemini-2.5-pro"),
  tools: {
    webSearch, databaseQuery, competitorAnalysis, context7Tools
  }
});

// Single call replaces 10+ individual tool calls
const marketAnalysis = await researchAgent.generate(
  "Research AI agent market for product launch",
  { maxSteps: 15 }
);
```

### **2. Technical Planning Agent**
**Purpose**: Handle technical feasibility and architecture planning

**Capabilities**:
- Validates technical feasibility using Context7 and documentation
- Creates comprehensive technical plans
- Synthesizes architecture recommendations

**Tools Used Internally**:
- `validate_technical_feasibility`
- Context7 library documentation
- Technical analysis tools

### **3. Project Analysis Agent**
**Purpose**: Handle complex project analysis and prioritization

**Capabilities**:
- Analyzes project complexity with multiple criteria
- Prioritizes tasks using intelligent algorithms
- Generates comprehensive project insights

**Tools Used Internally**:
- `analyze_project_complexity`, `prioritize_tasks`
- Project data analysis tools
- Multi-criteria decision frameworks

### **4. Report Generation Agent**
**Purpose**: Handle complex report and document generation

**Capabilities**:
- Generates comprehensive progress summaries
- Creates detailed handoff reports
- Synthesizes PRD documents from discovery data

**Tools Used Internally**:
- `generate_progress_summary`, `generate_handoff_report`, `generate_prd`
- Project data aggregation tools
- Document synthesis capabilities

## Implementation Benefits

- Maintained system responsiveness

### **Hybrid Flexibility**
- Agents can use direct tools when appropriate
- Flexible workflow composition
- Seamless integration between agent and direct operations

## Architecture Comparison

### **Before: 48 Individual Tool Calls**
```
User Request â†’ Tool 1 â†’ Raw Data
            â†’ Tool 2 â†’ Raw Data  
            â†’ Tool 3 â†’ Raw Data
            â†’ ... 48 tools â†’ 48 Raw Results
            â†’ Manual synthesis required
```

### **After: Strategic Agent Synthesis**
```
User Request â†’ Research Agent â†’ Internally uses 10 tools
                             â†’ Synthesizes results
                             â†’ Returns comprehensive analysis
             
             â†’ Direct Tool Call â†’ Immediate result (for simple ops)
             
             â†’ Technical Agent â†’ Internally uses 8 tools  
                              â†’ Synthesizes results
                              â†’ Returns technical plan
```

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 1**: Implement Mastra AI framework integration
2. **Phase 2**: Develop the 4 specialized synthesis agents
3. **Phase 3**: Integrate agents with existing Guidant services
4. **Phase 4**: Comprehensive testing and deployment

This strategic approach ensures optimal efficiency gains where they matter most (complex research/analysis) while keeping simple operations fast and straightforward.
