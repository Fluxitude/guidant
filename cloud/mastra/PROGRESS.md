# Strategic Agent Synthesis Architecture Implementation Progress

## Completed Work

### 1. TypeScript Error Fixes
- Added proper type definitions for the router and agents
- Updated import statements to match correct package names
- Implemented proper interfaces for agent classes
- Added missing type definitions for various components
- Updated model configuration to use Vertex AI with Gemini 2.5 Pro

### 2. Technical Research Agent Implementation
- Enhanced the Technical Research Agent with proper Context7 integration
- Implemented fallback mechanisms for when Context7 is unavailable
- Added web search fallback using Tavily
- Improved code example generation and library analysis
- Added comprehensive documentation parsing
- Updated to use Vertex AI with Gemini models instead of OpenAI

### 3. Redis State Management
- Created RedisStateManager class for state persistence
- Implemented caching mechanisms for routing decisions
- Added connection management and error handling
- Implemented methods for storing and retrieving agent state
- Added TTL-based cache expiration

### 4. Environment Configuration
- Updated configuration loading with Zod validation
- Created comprehensive environment variable definitions
- Added Redis configuration options
- Added model configuration for different agent types
- Implemented service enablement flags

### 5. Package and Configuration Updates
- Added @ai-sdk/vertexai as a dependency
- Created type definitions for AI SDK modules
- Updated tsconfig.json with proper module resolution paths
- Configured Vertex AI models for different agent types

## Remaining Work
