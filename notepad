Continue Mastra Server Debugging and MCP Integration

We were working on implementing autonomous research agents for Guidant using Mastra AI framework deployed on Google Cloud Run. The conversation evolved through several phases and we successfully implemented MCP tool integration patterns, but encountered server startup issues.

Current Status:

Mastra server is hanging during startup due to issues in the server creation code
Basic Node.js servers work fine (tested with simple HTTP server on port 3001)
Basic Mastra instance creation works (tested successfully)
Issue appears to be in the createServer function from ./server.ts
Identified problem: Line 78 in cloud/mastra/src/server.ts calls mastra.getMCPServers() which may not be a valid method in current Mastra version
Server hangs during startup, preventing testing of the 4 implemented workflows
Immediate Next Steps:

Fix the mastra.getMCPServers() call in the health endpoint (line 78 of cloud/mastra/src/server.ts)
Test server startup to ensure it runs without hanging
Test the 4 workflows via HTTP endpoints in fallback mode:
/workflows/researchOrchestrator/execute
/workflows/technicalDocumentationWorkflow/execute
/workflows/marketResearchWorkflow/execute
/workflows/uxResearchWorkflow/execute
Research correct MCP package names for Context7, Tavily, and Stagehand
Re-enable MCP client initialization with proper packages
Audit the fallback logic employed in the code and evaluate their effcacy and if they will serve our purpose best and provide recommedndations
Key Files:

cloud/mastra/src/index.ts - Main entry point (MCP client temporarily disabled)
cloud/mastra/src/server.ts - Express server with problematic getMCPServers() call
cloud/mastra/src/workflows/ - All 4 workflows with MCP integration patterns implemented
Architecture:

4 Mastra workflows: orchestrator routes to technology/market/ux specialized workflows
MCP tools integrated with fallback simulation when unavailable
Express server with comprehensive endpoints for research requests
Google Cloud Run deployment target
Please continue by fixing the server startup issue and testing the workflow functionality.
