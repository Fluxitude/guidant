### Tool Names and Descriptions
1. **generate_prd**: Generate comprehensive PRD from discovery session data
2. **assess_prd_quality**: Assess PRD quality with scoring and recommendations

## Quality Assessment Framework

### Five Quality Criteria
1. **Completeness (25% weight)**: Content length, essential sections, requirements detail
2. **Clarity (20% weight)**: Structure, headings, actionable language
3. **Technical Feasibility (20% weight)**: Technical specs, architecture, performance considerations
4. **Market Validation (15% weight)**: Market analysis, competitive research, business value
5. **Requirements Coverage (20% weight)**: Functional/non-functional requirements, user stories

### Quality Thresholds
- **Excellent**: 90+ points - Ready for immediate development
- **Good**: 75+ points - Ready for development with minor review
- **Acceptable**: 60+ points - Ready for task generation
- **Needs Improvement**: 40+ points - Requires significant work
- **Poor**: <40 points - Major revision needed

### Readiness Metrics
- **Development Readiness**: Quality score ≥ 75
- **Task Generation Readiness**: Quality score ≥ 60
- **Stakeholder Review Readiness**: Quality score ≥ 60
- **Confidence Level**: Based on score consistency and variance

## Template System Features

1. **COMPREHENSIVE**: Full-featured PRD with 10 sections (default for most projects)
2. **MINIMAL**: Essential sections only (3 sections for simple projects)
3. **TECHNICAL_FOCUSED**: Emphasis on technical specs and architecture

### Intelligent Selection Criteria
- **Project Complexity**: Low → Minimal, Medium/High → Comprehensive
- **Project Type**: API/Microservice → Technical, Web/Mobile → Comprehensive
- **Requirements Count**: <5 → Minimal, 5-15 → Comprehensive, >15 → Comprehensive
