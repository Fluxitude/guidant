- `track_performance` - Usage patterns, success rates, cost optimization

**Key Benefits**:
- Comprehensive analytics and insights
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Visual progress tracking with ASCII charts

## 🔧 Technical Excellence

### Integration Quality
- **Non-Destructive**: Preserves all existing Task Master functionality
- **Naming Conventions**: Follows established Task Master patterns (`kebab-case`, proper directory structure)
- **File Organization**: Uses existing `.taskmaster/reports/` and `.taskmaster/docs/` structure
- **Backward Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with existing Task Master commands

### Architecture Highlights
- **MCP-First Design**: All enhancements via MCP tools, no CLI modifications
- **Research Router**: Intelligent provider selection (Context7 vs Tavily)
- **Quality Assessor**: Automated PRD validation with 0-100 scoring
- **Session Manager**: Persistent state for memory-friendly workflows
- **Performance Tracker**: Comprehensive usage and success monitoring
