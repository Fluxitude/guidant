# Task Master Enhancement Plan

## Overview
Enhancement plan for Task Master to address workflow concerns for a two-person team (non-technical product owner with memory issues + AI implementor). Focus on MCP-based solutions to avoid CLI complexity, with enhanced research capabilities through Context7 and Tavily integration.

## **1. Pre-PRD Discovery Phase (Critical Missing Piece)**

### **Structured Requirements Discovery**
- **AI-Guided Discovery Sessions**: Conversational workflow for problem definition and requirements gathering
- **Research-Enhanced Discovery**: Automatic integration of Context7 and Tavily research during discovery
- **Memory-Friendly Session Management**: Persistent state, visual progress tracking, resumable sessions
- **Quality Validation Gates**: Built-in completeness and clarity assessment before PRD generation

### **Five-Stage Discovery Process**
- **Stage 1 - Problem Discovery**: AI-guided problem statement refinement, stakeholder identification, success criteria
- **Stage 2 - Market Research**: Tavily-powered competitive analysis, market opportunity validation
- **Stage 3 - Technical Feasibility**: Context7-powered architecture validation, technology stack assessment
- **Stage 4 - Requirements Synthesis**: Feature prioritization, user story generation, dependency mapping
- **Stage 5 - PRD Generation**: Automated PRD creation from discovery data with quality validation

### **MCP Tools for Discovery (AI-Orchestrated)**
- `start_discovery_session` - Initialize guided discovery with session state management
- `research_market_opportunity` - Tavily-powered market and competitive research
- `validate_technical_feasibility` - Context7-powered technical validation and architecture assessment
- `synthesize_requirements` - Convert discovery insights to structured requirements
- `generate_prd` - Create complete PRD from discovery session data
- `assess_prd_quality` - Validate PRD completeness and readiness for task generation

### **Workflow Orchestration Approach**
- **AI-Driven Orchestration**: AI automatically calls MCP tools in sequence based on natural language conversation
- **No Workflow Engine**: Leverages existing MCP patterns where AI handles tool coordination (like `analyze-complexity` â†’ `expand-all`)
- **Session Continuity**: Discovery state persists across tool calls via `.taskmaster/state.json` and MCP session context
- **Natural Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with existing `initialize_project` workflow through conversational interface

## **2. Enhanced Research Architecture (High Priority)**

### **Multi-Provider Research System**
- **Context7 Integration**: MCP-based technical documentation access for libraries/frameworks
- **Tavily Integration**: Cost-effective, AI-optimized search engine as Perplexity alternative
- **Intelligent Research Routing**: Automatic selection of optimal research provider based on task type
- **Hybrid Research Synthesis**: Combine technical docs, general research, and best practices

### **Research Quality Improvements**
- **Technical Documentation Access**: Real-time, version-specific library documentation via Context7
- **Cost-Optimized Search**: 60-75% cost reduction through Tavily integration

- Direct AI chat for implementation assistance
- Shared documents for requirements and progress

### **Hybrid Approach**
- Task Master for AI implementor only
- Simple visual tools for product owner
- Weekly sync meetings for coordination
- AI-generated progress reports for alignment

## **Bottom Line Recommendation**

**Try MCP enhancements first** - if they successfully reduce complexity and cognitive load, Task Master becomes viable. **If not, pivot to simpler tools** that prioritize usability over sophistication for your two-person team constraints.
